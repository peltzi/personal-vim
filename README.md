Mainly for my Python editing stuff.:

    F2 - toggle paste mode
    F5 - toggle spellcheck (en_us)
    F8 - autocorrect PEP8 and refresh lint
    F9 - toggle foldmethod (in-case expr gets too heavy for large files)

Seems to work well enough for Chef (Ruby) too. Plugins for some other stuff
like Go and TOML also present.

Outside requirements: fzf

Intended for my personal use mostly.
